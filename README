## Docker

### How to run the docker image?

If you have a docker setup, including environment export, up and running, you
can `make run` to have a stack up in a few seconds. The first run will take a
bit of time as docker downloads the PHP/Apache image, but subsequent runs
should take less than a second.

Running the code using the docker method have several benefits. One of the most
obvious is that the codebase is decoupled from the documents base: while the
code is running in an isolated container within docker, your documents can stay
on your computer wherever you want. You just need to specify `DOCPATH=...` on
run to have your documents mounted (read/write) into the runtime container.

For example::

    DOCPATH=/Users/johndoe/Documents/LegalDocuments make start

### How to access the app?

If you're running Docker on Linux, the daemon is usually running locally, and
thus the exposed ports will be accessible using the localhost ip (aka
127.0.0.1).

If you're running Docker on MacOSX (probably also true on windows), docker is
using a virtual machine to run its daemon and thus you will access the
container using the virtual machine IP. This IP depends on your setup, defaults
on OSX is 192.168.99.100. To get the actual IP of the virtual machine running
on your computer, you can use `docker-machine ip`.

Defaults should be:

- http://127.0.0.1:8080/ on Linux
- http://192.168.99.100:8080/ on OSX

### How to change which port the container will expose on docker daemons machine?

You can change the exposed port by using the DOCKER_HTTP_PORT environment variable while running the make command.

For example, to listen on the 1234 port, use:

    DOCPATH=/Users/johndoe/Documents/LegalDocuments DOCKER_HTTP_PORT=1234 make start
